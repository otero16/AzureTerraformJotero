Title: Azure Terraform Examples 

Description of this repository: 

This is my own personal Terraform repository code to create some Azure Cloud resources. Going from the most simple ones to the most complex scenarios. The goal is to make this as simple as possible, avoinding third party tools such as Visual code Studio, Azure Pipelines, and other code orchestrators.

Usage:

Just download the .md file, you will see that my goal is to make this as simple as possible, so all my projects will be self contained in only one file.

After you have downloaded the .md you just need to execute the file using terraform to create the resources. The goal is to make them self contained so they will work on any subscription as i will try to add some random name generation to prevent any conflic with previously existing resources.

Recommendations:

- You will one powerful hacking tool called notepad, this will give you the power of greyskul and text editor capabilities. You can use any other text editor if you are brave like that. 
- You will need a Windows running machine, if anyone has ever seen one before, mine just sits on the table. 
- You will need to have a workign azure subscription, and money for your azure subscription. Ensure to monitor those expenses. 
- You will need a powershell console in your local windows machine, this will allow you to connect to your azure subscription and execute the scripts
- You will need to install terraform in Windows [Installation link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)


You can run this from any powershell console in a windows running machine, you just need to have installed terraform.
